hi, with this simple mpp script you can steal i mean borrow colors from other people, and other stuff.

i won't focus much on this project (yet), because i don't see any actual real use for this other than info about metadata and the main thing: stealing borrowing colors.

this version of colorsteal is only for the public, since i'll add private features to myself, because i love being different, if i am not different enough.

but anyway, i'd like to make this project more accessible to beginners and optimize the code (maybe a bit too far...)

this is just some shitshow i made out of boredom, have fun messing around, and always put your own perspective of colorsteal in the "me" branch.
